# etomata
*Etomata* is a Selenium driven Java framework designed to mimic human-to-platform media actions

Social media platforms are built around the collection of **user data**. People may choose to privatize the reach of their shared media. However, how effective is this privatization in actuality? The goal of this project is to use a neural networking technique to create a **synthetic** sense of **relation** between media users. This relation can be used to break the privatization barrier and collect data for **information synthesis**.
